                    <h3>August 2021</h3>
                    <p>After completing my 1st Year, I entered an internship with Al Jazeera Media Network as an ERP Intern. I was trained to utilise SAP modules such as Finance, HR and Procurement along with their business processes which enabled me to relate between academia and the industry.
                     Most importantly, I gained friends that taught me how to conduct myself within the work environment and helped me build strong people skills.

                    <h3>July 2022</h3>
                    <p>My previous experience allowed me to join placement year at SAP. 
                      
                      4 other interns and I became part of a team that provided a creative presence to the company by creating multimedia assets such as Microsites, Videos, and Branded Decks to support the Presales and Sales departments to personalise commercial deals and demonstrations, known as the Innovation Labs.

                    <p>I was able to build new skills to adapt to the demands of the working environment and used my business understanding augmented with design skills to contribute to deals more strategically, allowing me to gain a network. I contributed to events such as gamifying SAP Solutions and facilitated a hackathon for SAP Build Apps.</p>

                    <p>
                    I started to work with cross-functional teams to gain deeper understanding of the core business.
                    I shadowed the Lead Analytics Solution Advisor under the BTP Presales Team where I participated in customer and team meetings to learn SAP Analytics Cloud's system architecture, connections, planning capabilities and the IBCS Reporting Standard, enabling me to become a
                   presenter in a product demonstration.

                    <h3>July 2023</h3>
                    <p>At the end of our placement, our final task was to pass the skills we've learned to the 3 new interns that joined the team. We onborded them with our workflows, projects, and invited them to our outings so we could build stronger bonds. While this concluded our journey, we were confident that the new interns would reach far greater heights.</p>

                    <h3>September 2023</h3>
                    <p>
                    During my flight to Qatar, the person who sat next to me engaged a conversation and discovered he was the Managing Director of Red Rock International. This resulted in an internship where I gained a comprehensive view of leadership and management by attending their training courses.  I used my skills from SAP to contribute to different departments such as HR, Marketing and their Team Build events.
